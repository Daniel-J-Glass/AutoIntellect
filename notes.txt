imulation itself. The next steps involve drafting a plan to emulate a dice rolling simulation, adjusting the physics engine, and ensuring the dice movement is influenced by mouse dragging. User feedback has been integrated into the planning process, confirming that no additional features are required beyond those already specified.

The user has confirmed that the simulation should emulate rolling a square dice, influenced by mouse dragging movements, and should come to rest in a stable position with a sense of weight and momentum. No random behavior is desired, and only one dice is necessary. There are no specific requirements for the dice's appearance. The main concern is the quality of the simulation. Planning is required to determine the necessary changes to the code to achieve this new goal. The next steps include drafting a plan, adjusting the physics engine, and ensuring dice movement is influenced by mouse dragging. User feedback has been integrated into the planning process, confirming that no additional features are required beyond those already specified.

Drafting a detailed plan for the dice rolling simulation:
1. Implement gravity to simulate the downward force on the dice.
2. Introduce friction to simulate resistance when the dice contacts surfaces.
3. Add collision detection to handle interactions between the dice and the environment.
4. Code mouse dragging influence to control the dice's initial velocity and direction.
5. Ensure the dice comes to rest in a stable position, simulating weight and momentum.
6. Develop a comparison mechanism to verify the uniqueness and relevance of the new code iteration.
7. Streamline documentation to focus on actionable insights and current challenges.
8. Validate the new code draft against the defined project objectives.
9. Incorporate user feedback as a pre-validation step to fine-tune the simulation.

The plan will be validated with the user before proceeding to code implementation.
