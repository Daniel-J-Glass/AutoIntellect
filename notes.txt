Initial review of past interactions and notes has been performed. Progress tracking indicates that enhanced collision detection feature code has been written for 'interactive_box_simulation.py', and it's marked as [Done].

Mouse interaction feature is noted as [In Progress] and requires completion of coding, followed by testing of both features. Post-coding, the user should be updated on progress with the opportunity for feedback.

Key points noted for behavior:
- Avoid redundancy by focusing on incomplete tasks based on notes.
- Use 'write_code' to draft necessary Python code and modify behavior based on user feedback.
- Provide regular progress updates to the user.

Task List:
1. Finalize Python code for mouse interactions. [In Progress]
2. Conduct tests for new features (collision detection, mouse interactions) within the simulation. [Pending]
3. Update the user on progress and request feedback. [Pending]

Next steps involve completing the mouse interaction feature coding, testing all new features, and updating the user with an opportunity for feedback.

Workflow efficiency and structured updates are emphasized for effective task progression.
