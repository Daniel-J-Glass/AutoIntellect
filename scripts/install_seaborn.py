def process_data(data):
    """
    Process the input data and return the processed data.

    This function takes a single argument 'data' which represents the data
    to be processed. The actual processing performed will depend on the
    nature of the input data and the desired outcome, which are not specified
    in this description.

    Parameters:
    data: The input data to be processed. This could be of any type depending
          on the use case (e.g., list, dict, DataFrame, etc.)

    Returns:
    The processed data which could be of the same or different type as the
    input, depending on the intended processing steps implemented.

    Example usage:
    >>> raw_data = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> processed = process_data(raw_data)
    >>> print(processed)

    Note:
    - The example above assumes the 'process_data' function does some form of
      processing on a list of integers.
    - It is necessary to modify the function's body to do the actual processing
      as required for your use case.

    """
    Save the given results to a file specified by file_path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : any
        The results data to be saved. This could be of any data type that can be written to a file.

    file_path : str
        The path to the file where the results should be saved.

    Raises
    ------
    IOError
        If the file could not be opened or written to, an IOError will be raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> my_results = {'score': 95, 'timestamp': '2023-04-01T12:00:00'}
    >>> save_results(my_results, 'results.txt')
    # This will save the string representation of my_results to 'results.txt'
    
    Notes
    -----
    The function simply writes the string representation of the results to the
    file, it does not handle serialization for complex objects or handle any
    specific file formats.
