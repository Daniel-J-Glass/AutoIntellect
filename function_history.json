The user has also confirmed to proceed with the plan.\n\nGiven this information, I will now proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Draft a detailed plan for the dice rolling simulation, including the physics engine adjustments for gravity, friction, and collision detection.\n2. Ensure the dice movement is influenced by mouse dragging and comes to rest in a stable position with a sense of weight and momentum.\n3. Develop a comparison mechanism to ensure the uniqueness and relevance of the new code iteration.\n4. Streamline documentation to focus on actionable insights and current challenges.\n5. Validate the new code draft against the defined project objectives.\n6. Incorporate a pre-validation step using user feedback to fine-tune the simulation before finalizing the code.\n\nI will start by taking notes on the detailed plan for the dice rolling simulation. Then, I will use the \"write_code\" tool to implement the physics engine adjustments and mouse dragging influence. Finally, I will request user feedback to validate the simulation's behavior before finalizing the code. Let's begin by taking notes on the detailed plan."}, {"take_notes": "Response:\nSuccessfully added to notes", "request_feedback": "Response:\nRequested feedback from user with message: I have drafted a detailed plan for the dice rolling simulation, including physics engine adjustments and mouse dragging influence.
